## Project name
The project is named Bifrost after the legendary rainbow bridge from Norse
mythology, which connects the world of humans (Midgard) with the realm of the
gods (Asgard). In a similar spirit, this application acts as a bridge between
two different data storage systems, a relational SQLite database and a Blazegraph
SPARQL one, providing a unified interface to the data stored in both.
